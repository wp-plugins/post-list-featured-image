This plugin adds a feature to NextGEN Gallery Plguin to add an image from the WP Media Library.

== Description ==

If you use NextGEN Gallery, then you know that, when you create a gallery, you must upload the images for that gallery, which is then stored in a separate folder from your WordPress Media Library. For large websites with hundreds and hundreds of images, like some of my high profile clients, this can add strain on the server, causing long page load times, in turn effecting Google rankings.

Now, with our NextGEN Gallery Media Library Addon, you will have the option of adding images that are already stored in your Media Library. Just like adding an image to a page or post, adding an image to your NextGEN Gallery can be a matter of clicking a button and finding an image you have already uploaded.

== Installation ==

1. **(Recommended)** Install directly from the WP Directory through your admin panel Plugins > Add New > Search for "NextGEN Gallery Madia Library Addon". Click install under the name, and activate when prompted. 

2. Upload nextgen-gallery-media-library-addon.zip via "wp-admin/plugin-install.php?tab=upload" or if using FTP, unzip nextgen-gallery-media-library-addon.zip and upload `/nextgen-gallery-media-library-addon/` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

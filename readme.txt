A plugin that adds the "Featured Image" column in admin posts and pages list.

== Description ==

Finally a simple plugin that adds the "Featured Image" column in admin posts and pages list. It lets the wordpress site owners see which posts or pages have a featured image set. 

Of course, this is mainly intended for use on the Post List page, since most themes require a featured image be set for the excerpt thumbnail image. It doesn't seem like much, and the plugin is truly non-invasive to the rest fo the WP install. But the value that this simple tool can have on the overall organization for Admins and Developers of WordPress websites is priceless.
By enhancing the plugin with the Pro Addon, you can easily change, add, or remove images with the Quick Edit feature, directly from your Posts List Page.

== Installation ==

1. **Important** Backup your files and database.
